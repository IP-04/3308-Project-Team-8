ISSUES
* difficulty covering project blindspots, i.e. features we haven't considered
    - coordinating ideas between ourselves

* want to make pages look consistent with stylesheet


* Logistics are a concern
    - make sure everyone is on the same pages
    - github branching working properly
    - first group project utilizing these industry practices 
        - look into locking main branch?

GOALS
* finish basic html pages
    - then move on to implenting page to database communication

* plan to finish front end this week
    - add database skeleton, first table iterations
    - limited by no API implementation for now
