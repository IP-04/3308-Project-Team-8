BookHive strives to host a community of users who share and discover books together.

## Brief Application Description
Bookhive is a community-driven platform for book lovers to explore, review, and recommend their favorite reads. Like Goodreads or Letterboxd, users can upload and read reviews for a wide selection of books. With a privacy feature allowing reviews to be shared only with approved friends, Bookhive creates a personalized, social experience. A recommendation algorithm suggests books based on both user and friend preferences, while samples of each book are available to preview. Bookhive creates a welcoming environment for readers to discover new titles and share their literary passions with like-minded individuals.
